Gaussian Naive Bayes in Machine Learning

📌 Introduction

Gaussian Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem with the assumption that features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. It is simple, efficient, and widely used for text classification, spam detection, sentiment analysis, and medical diagnosis.

⚙️ How It Works

Uses Bayes’ Theorem to calculate posterior probability.

Assumes feature independence (Naive assumption).

For continuous data, it models likelihood using the Gaussian probability density function (PDF).

Predicts the class with the highest posterior probability.

🛠️ Applications

Spam Email Detection

Sentiment Analysis

Medical Diagnosis

Document Classification

Real-time Prediction Systems

📊 Advantages

Simple and easy to implement.

Works well with small datasets.

Efficient in terms of memory and computation.

Performs well with categorical and continuous data.

⚠️ Limitations

Assumes independence of features, which may not hold true in real-world datasets.

Struggles when features are highly correlated.

Requires normally distributed data for Gaussian NB.
